# Predicting Readmissions
This project analyzes CMS Medicare data and applies machine learning to predict hospital readmissions for Medicare recipients. 

Data was cleaned and prepared using Tableau Prep. The dataset was reduced to the past 10 years, null values dropped, and columns using actual costs were dropped to analyze only standardized costs. Correlations were calculated, and machine learning algorithms were applied. A Tableau dashboard was also created to visualize data for the top features. 

Contributers were Anna Dyar, Jackie Cheng, Janice Mathew, and Jenny Nguyen.
